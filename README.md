# Speech_Recognition

This repo is a project for training a neural network for simple speech commands from googles dataset on kaggle.

To do list:
1) Download data using Kaggle's API

2) Prepare Data for training
    - Data is organized in folders representing each target. Decide How to incorporate target data into the dataset
    - Convert data into spectrograms
    - Prepare notebook that does this called wrangling
    
3) Decide how to setup the data for a model to interpret
    - Spectrogram or MFCC or something else
    - create notebook called exploration
    
    - Instead perform cleaning like resampling
    
3) Decide on model type. CNN, or something else

4) Build model in notebook.
